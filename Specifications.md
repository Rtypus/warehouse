# Specifications

Congratulations! You have been hired to join our FRA 241 company. We gladly present you
with your new project to prove your worth. Our company is expanding. We have several
warehouses located all around the company. Each warehouse has different capacity. However,
there is no system connected all the warehouse for the smart system. These are some
specifications of the warehouse.
### Warehouse Specifications
  - A warehouse has many rows.
  - A row is a 2-dimensional grid.
  - Each space in a grid is used to store an item.
  - Each warehouse has a robot to pick up and store items.
  - There are 5 warehouses. Warehouse 1 connects with a conveyor belt, Warehouse 2, and
    Warehouse 3. Warehouse 2 connects with Warehouse 4 and 5.
  - There is a robot running around to transfer items from a warehouse to a conveyor belt.
  - Warehouse 1, 2, and 3 have 5 rows of 10x10 grid.
  - Warehouse 4 has 7 rows of 5x5 grid.
  - Warehouse 5 has 20 rows of 20x20 grid.
  - The conveyor belt can hold up to 10 items, first-come-first-serve.
    You need to design a program such that
  - When received an order, a robot will pick up an item from a warehouse and transfer it
    to the belt.
  - When received an order, the belt will output 1 item at a time.
  - When received a command, a robot will store an item at a specific location.
Your job is to design a system to accomplish these requirements. I recommend that you should
utilize your Data Structure knowledge. Writing the program using Object Oriented
Programming can simplify your job, making your life easier.
Product ID
Each product has a unique id in a form of 4 characters: xyz
x represents a type of the item. It has a value of A to Y.
y represents a row number of the item. It has a value of 1 to 5.
z represents a row number of the item. It has a value of 00 to 99.
For example, a product id A125 should be at warehouse 1, row 1, and slot number 25.
### Input Command
There are several commands we can give to the system. The commands have following
formats.
- 0XXXX Retrieve a product id XXXX
- 1XXXX Store a product id XXXX
- 2XY00 Sort warehouse X at row Y
- 30000 Retrieve a product from the conveyor belt
- 40000 Output information of all warehouses
- 5XXXX Search for a product ID XXXX
- 9XXXXYYYY Manually put a product id XXXX at position YYYY
